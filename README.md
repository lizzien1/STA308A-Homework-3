This is a conditional code that runs a Guess The Number game. It allows the user to play a game of guessing the number with lower and upper bounds. If the guess is too high the user will guess again and if the user is too low the user will guess again. The user guesses until they get it correct and the game will end and say the amount of guesses. Then the code will be able to list the random number, the number of guesses, and what guesses the user made.
